Description: RNA modifications play critical roles in regulating gene expression, yet their dynamic behavior at single-cell resolution remains largely unexplored.  To address this, we developed VeloRM, a computational framework that models the kinetics of RNA modifications—such as m⁶A methylation and A-to-I editing—by quantifying their gain and loss over pseudotime at single-nucleotide resolution.  Applying VeloRM to scDART-seq data, we uncovered distinct regulatory programs: most m⁶A modifications occur prior to splicing, though a subset arises post-splicing;  in contrast, A-to-I editing primarily takes place during or after splicing, following markedly different kinetics from m⁶A.  VeloRM accurately reconstructs modification-associated cellular trajectories and identifies stage-specific modification patterns that influence RNA fate.  Notably, m⁶A levels correlate with mRNA decay, with most regulatory effects observed in pre-mRNA, although some modification sites show a positive association with mature mRNA abundance.  Together, these findings provide new insights into the dynamic regulation of the epitranscriptome at single-cell resolution and establish a powerful framework for studying RNA modification kinetics in development and disease.
